## Planning:
[X] Create a method caled ```getComputerChoice``` that randomly returns either 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'. (This function will be used to make a computer's play)
[] Create a method that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The method should take two parameters: *playerSelection* and *computerSelection*. The method should return a string that declares the winner of the round (i.e: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock")
NOTE: Return results of this function call, not console.log(). Will use this return later on.
